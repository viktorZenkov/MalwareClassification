# MalwareClassification
This repository contains the files used in the technical report "Dynamic data fusion using multi-input models for malware classification" by Viktor Zenkov and Jason Laska.

Using the data from Microsoft's malware competition at https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification, we used machine learning to train a neural network to classify malware.

We transformed the data using the files hexParsingCode.py and textParsingCode.py. The files classifyingTextNUMBERS.py, classifyingTextMULTI.py, and classifyingTextENSEMBLE.py were run to create models. The file classifyingFunctions.py contains supporting functions.
