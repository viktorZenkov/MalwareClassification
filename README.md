# MalwareClassification
Malware classification machine learning code for investigation reproducibility.

Using the data from Microsoft's malware competition at https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification, we attempted to use machine learning to train a neural network to classify malware. The files in this repository were used for training.

We transformed the data from https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification/data using the files hexParsingCode.py and textParsingCode.py.

The files classifyingTextNUMBERS.py, classifyingTextMULTI.py, and classifyingTextENSEMBLE.py were run to create models. The file classifyingFunctions.py contains supporting functions.
